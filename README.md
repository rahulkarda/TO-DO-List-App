## TO-DO List App
A simple TO-DO list app where user can add their tasks and can delete only the completed task or all the tasks at once. Built using vanilla JS and Web Storage API to store the to-do list.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.

[Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies.

## Optimizations
When I will improve this project, I would start by adding the following features -

      1. Marking a task as Important
      
      2. Embedding images and videos
      
      3. Sync and host to web server 
      
## Lessons Learned
My learning was focused on making the use of Web Storage API and to create a simple UI and a smooth UX for the users to create a TO-DO list in the browser itself.
Seperation of Concerns - separating the application into distinct sections, so each section addresses a separate concern. Learned how the web storage API works and difference between local storage and session storage.
